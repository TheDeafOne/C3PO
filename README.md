# Welcome to C3PO!
---
## The Goal
This is a short program in response to a code question with the following description:
> Given an integer between 0-1000, return the verbal equivalent as a String
>

## How it works
C3PO uses modulo logic and integer division to isolate individual digits in a number. In the context of the program, this allows us to identify what numbers are in the 1s, 10s, 100s, and 1000s place, where we can then act accordingly. 

## Testing
The unit tests are to quickly and accurately display the translator performance relative to a dataset of known integer-string pairs. This was useful for adjusting minor logic changes after having completed a majority of the program.
